# Libraryhw3
# Creating a public repository to add changed to code based on hw2.
# Mostly using similar code but adding openAI.
# Basing this mostly on the HomeWork 2 file as well as the resturants.py file
# Replace the API key with yours and Use npm install openai
# In addition to the following instructions:

# To run the frontend and server, follow these steps:
# Install npm and Node through the command line (installing through Google or something can cause issues)
# Pull the project through git on your machine.
# Run npm install in the root of the project directory.
# Run npm install in the backend project folder.
# Run the frontend by using npm run dev in the root of the project
# Navigate to the backend folder
# Run node hw2.js
# Since this is hw3 you would use run node hw3.js instead.

# The endpoint can be called like: GET http://localhost:3000/suggestions
# Origionally the code needed an index but removed the requirement so had to remove build prompt.
